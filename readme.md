# A simple tool for relocating objects to a coordinate.

While default Blender object property tools allow for coordinate input, there is no way to quickly select a set of objects and relocate them to a specific coordinate.

This tool allows for each object within a selection to move to that coordinate, while also giving the option to retain spacing between these objects, and move the group center to the desired coordinate.
